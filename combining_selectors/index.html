        <h1>69th Emmy Awards</h1>
        <h2>September 17th 2017</h2>
        <p>Much to most people's surprise, popular <span>Netflix TV Show</span>, Master Of None bagged Best Female Writer for a Comedy Series with Lena Waithe being the first ever black woman to do so.</p>

        <p>A surprise to most was that ,arguably the most watched sci-fi series currently, WestWorld missed out on all the categories it was nominated.</p>
        <p>A personal disappointment was that <span>Bob Odenkirk</span>, lead actor in Better Call Saul did not win the Best Male Actor.</p>
